# Changelog

## v1.6.1 – Mobile save fixes and session validation (2026-05-07)
- Fix: tasks, children, and meals silently failed to save on mobile when the session had expired — API calls now throw on non-OK responses and show an error message
- Fix: expired sessions now detected on app startup — stale tokens are cleared before the user enters the admin panel, so the PIN prompt appears upfront instead of after failed save attempts
- New `GET /api/auth/validate` endpoint used to verify the stored token at startup
- Added `sessionExpired` and `saveFailed` error messages in both languages

## v1.6.0 – Norwegian/English language support (2026-05-06)
- Language toggle button (🇬🇧/🇳🇴) in the home screen header and admin panel
- All UI strings, day/month names, and motivational tip messages fully translated
- Language preference stored in `localStorage`

## v1.5.4 – Bug fixes (2026-05-06)
- Fix: admin settings (feature toggles) not saving on mobile — caused by `sessionStorage` being cleared when mobile browsers background-kill tabs; switched to `localStorage`
- Fix: Cosmos auto-update was disabled (`cosmos-auto-update` label was `"false"`)

## v1.5.3 – Family messages, emoji picker, mobile improvements (2026-05-06)
- Family messages board on the home screen — leave notes for the family, dismiss when done
- Messages appear below the dinner plan in the right column (not full-width below everything)
